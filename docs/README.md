# GregoShop (personal fork)

This repository is a **personal fork** of [PrestaShop/PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop). It is not the official PrestaShop project.

PrestaShop is a e-commerce platform, both through modules and themes. Developers can override the default components and behaviors. **That is the purpose of this fork:** customize and override core components and behaviors for personal / shop use, while tracking upstream `9.x.x` on the integration branch `dev`.

## What this fork is for

- Track upstream PrestaShop `9.x.x` on branch `dev`
- Carry shop-oriented fixes and overrides (installer, cookies, FO/BO behavior, and related core changes)

## What this fork is not

- Not the canonical source for PrestaShop releases
